# Package-level install trust check for automated and human consumers

## Summary

This RFC proposes an opt-in, registry-side mechanism that lets an npm publisher
classify every tarball fetch for a package as either legitimate automation,
a verified human, or unwanted traffic. The registry's tarball endpoint becomes
a per-package policy proxy with three lanes:

1. **CI and legitimate automation** receive a **zero-config heuristic automation
   pass**. The registry uses passive signals (IP/ASN reputation, User-Agent and
   TLS fingerprint, and an echoed challenge header) to recognize automation and
   serve the tarball immediately. No tokens, browser, CAPTCHA, or manual setup is
   required.
2. **Human-driven installs** are directed through a **hardware-bound proof of
   humanity** using WebAuthn / platform biometric authenticators (Touch ID,
   Windows Hello, hardware security keys). No visual or cognitive CAPTCHA is
   offered.
3. **Known scrapers, abuse networks, and obvious non-human traffic** are
   classified as `spam_user` (returned externally as `blocked`) and receive a
   403 `TRUST_CHECK_BLOCKED` response. They are not offered a challenge, fallback,
   or CAPTCHA.

The design only affects packages that explicitly opt in through
`publishConfig.trustCheck`.

## Motivation

1. **Public download counts are noise.** npm package download statistics mix
   real users, CI pipelines, mirrors, scrapers, malware sandboxes, and
   misconfigured loops. Publishers cannot tell whether a spike represents
   adoption, abuse, or infrastructure traffic.
2. **Manual per-package CI tokens do not scale.** Requiring every pipeline to
   create, scope, and rotate an npm access token for each package is expensive,
   excludes public forks and one-off scripts, and still leaves publishers
   blind to human vs automated use.
3. **Visual and cognitive CAPTCHAs are no longer a meaningful barrier.** Modern
   LLM "Computer Use" agents, computer-vision systems, and speech-to-text
   models can solve image grids, audio challenges, and logic puzzles. CAPTCHAs
   also create accessibility friction and give a false sense of security.
4. **Some packages need a human in the loop.** Security tooling, identity
   libraries, and MCP servers may want to ensure a human approved a first
   install, while still allowing every CI pipeline to pull exact versions
   non-interactively.
5. **The registry is the right enforcement point.** The registry already serves
   the tarball. Adding an optional policy check there is transparent,
   enforceable, and does not require package contents to change.

## Detailed Explanation

### Package policy

A new optional package-level setting controls the gate. It lives in the registry
package document and is set from `package.json` at publish time:

```jsonc
{
  "publishConfig": {
    "trustCheck": "require"   // or "audit" or "none" (default)
  }
}
```

Allowed values:

- `"none"` (default): the existing install flow is unchanged.
- `"audit"`: the registry records an `install-trust-check` event for every
  tarball fetch but does not block the install.
- `"require"`: the registry requires a valid trust check token before serving
  the tarball. Both heuristic automation and hardware-bound human tokens are
  accepted, so CI and headless automation continue to work out of the box.
- `"require-human"`: the registry only accepts `human` trust check tokens.
  This blocks pure unattended automation and is intended for extreme-risk
  packages. CI must then use an approved `automation` or `service` token, or
  OIDC trusted publishing.

### Heuristic automation pass (zero-config)

When `npm install` runs in a CI or headless environment, the registry classifies
the request using passive telemetry. No client configuration is required.

Signals in the CI signal catalog:

- **IP/ASN reputation.** The registry maintains a list of autonomous systems
  known to host CI runners: GitHub Actions, AWS CodeBuild, GitLab CI, Azure
  Pipelines, Google Cloud Build, Vercel, Netlify, and others. Public IP range
  feeds keep the catalog current.
- **User-Agent and TLS fingerprinting.** Standard CI `User-Agent` strings and
  headless TLS fingerprints are recognized. A desktop browser fingerprint from
  a cloud IP is treated as ambiguous, not automatic.
- **Honeypot header.** The registry's metadata response includes a hidden
  `X-NPM-Trust-Check-Challenge` header with a nonce. The official npm CLI echoes
  the nonce in the subsequent tarball request. Naive scrapers that skip the
  metadata fetch or do not mirror headers correctly fall through to the human or
  blocked path.
- **Abuse signals.** Known bulk-scraper networks, TOR exit nodes, open proxies,
  exploit-tooling `User-Agent` strings, failed challenge patterns, and clients
  that exceed rate limits accumulate a negative `spam_score`. These requests do
  not get a challenge; they are denied immediately.

Classification flow:

```text
Client GET /:pkg/-/:pkg-:version.tgz
       (includes npm-trust-check header, UA, echoed challenge)

Registry:
  score = heuristic_automation_score(ip, asn, ua, tls_fp, challenge)
  spam_score = abuse_score(ip, asn, ua, tls_fp, rate_limit_violations, challenge)

  if spam_score >= SPAM_THRESHOLD:
       emit install-trust-check event with tokenKind "spam_user"
       return 403 TRUST_CHECK_BLOCKED
  else if score >= AUTOMATION_THRESHOLD:
       emit install-trust-check event with tokenKind "heuristic-automation"
       return tarball + short-lived unattended trust check token
  else if score >= AMBIGUOUS_THRESHOLD:
       return tarball + short-lived "unattended" token with lower rate limit
  else:
       return 428 HUMAN_TRUST_CHECK_REQUIRED
```

The `heuristic-automation` and `unattended` tokens are anonymous, short-lived,
and cached by the CLI in `~/.npm/_trust-checks`. They require no account, no
browser, and no manual token.

A developer on a cloud VM who is falsely classified as automation can force the
human flow with:

```bash
NPM_TRUST_CHECK=human npm install <pkg>
```

### Hardware-bound human trust check

When the registry sees a residential IP, an unknown scraper, a suspicious
headless browser, or any request that does not pass the automation heuristic, it
returns a `428 Precondition Required` with a `trust_check_url`.

The npm CLI intercepts the response and triggers a native OS-level biometric
prompt using WebAuthn / FIDO2 with `userVerification` required:

```text
Registry:
  return 428 Precondition Required
         + { error: "HUMAN_TRUST_CHECK_REQUIRED",
             trust_check_url: "https://www.npmjs.com/trust-check/install?nonce=..." }

CLI (npm version that advertises trust-check support):
  open OS native prompt:
       "Touch ID to install mcp-trustcard" (macOS)
       "Windows Hello to install mcp-trustcard" (Windows)
       "Use your security key to install mcp-trustcard" (cross-platform)

  User performs WebAuthn / passkey ceremony with user presence
  (fingerprint, face, PIN, or hardware security key tap).

  Authenticator signs the registry nonce with a hardware- or platform-backed
  private key scoped to npmjs.com and the package name.

  Registry verifies the signature, issues a short-lived human trust check
  token, and returns it to the CLI.

  CLI retries tarball request with:
       Authorization: Trust-Check <token>
  Registry validates token and returns tarball.
```

Why this beats LLM Computer Use:

- The private key lives in a secure enclave (TPM, Secure Enclave, YubiKey).
- User presence is required: a physical biometric or PIN entry.
- A remote LLM agent running in a cloud sandbox or via desktop automation does
  not have access to the developer's fingerprint sensor, Face ID, or hardware
  security key.
- The signature is cryptographically bound to the `npmjs.com` origin, so replay
  from a fake page is not possible.

### Reputation fast pass

A logged-in npm CLI user with a high-reputation account can skip the biometric
prompt for `trustCheck: "require"` packages.

Qualifying signals (configurable by registry policy):

- Account age greater than a threshold (for example, 6 months).
- 2FA enabled.
- Linked, aged GitHub account.
- No recent abuse reports or rate-limit violations.
- Prior successful hardware trust check on the same device.

When the account qualifies, the registry issues a `human` trust check token
without a new biometric ceremony. This keeps daily development smooth while
fresh burner accounts and LLM agents cannot bypass the gate.

### Optional higher-trust tokens

For CI environments that the heuristic catalog misses, or for publishers using
`"require-human"`, the CLI still supports explicit tokens:

- **`automation`** — long-lived granular access token for a specific CI
  pipeline.
- **`service`** — registry-registered token for mirrors and public indexers.

These are opt-in. The default path for CI is the zero-config heuristic pass.

### Rate limits and logging

- `heuristic-automation` tokens receive a baseline CI rate limit.
- `unattended` (ambiguous) tokens receive a lower rate limit.
- `human` tokens receive a higher rate limit because the user has proven
  possession of an authenticator or passed reputation checks.
- `automation` and `service` tokens receive publisher- or registrar-controlled
  rate limits.
- `spam_user` (externally `blocked`) requests emit an `install-trust-check`
  event but no tarball is served. The response is 403 `TRUST_CHECK_BLOCKED`.
- Each tarball fetch or blocked attempt emits a standardized
  `install-trust-check` event:

```json
{
  "package": "mcp-trustcard",
  "version": "3.1.0",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-18T00:00:00Z",
  "tokenKind": "heuristic-automation",
  "trustCheckIdHash": "sha256:...",
  "automationSignals": ["asn:github-actions", "ua:ci", "challenge:echoed"],
  "userAgent": "npm/12.0.0",
  "ipHash": "sha256:..."
}
```

Blocked (`spam_user`) requests include a `tokenKind` of `spam_user` and the
set of abuse signals that triggered the deny decision, without exposing the
underlying raw data.

No raw IP or token value is retained. Signal names are logged as categories,
not raw fingerprints.

### Privacy and security

- The heuristic automation pass uses only network and client metadata the
  registry already sees; no new tracking pixels or browser scripts are added.
- `unattended` and `heuristic-automation` tokens are anonymous and short-lived.
- `human` tokens are tied to an npm account session or a device-bound public
  key, not to a raw fingerprint.
- WebAuthn / passkey is the default proof-of-humanity mechanism.
- The `X-NPM-Trust-Check-Challenge` header is a nonce, not a cookie or tracker.

### Abuse prevention

- `"require-human"` may only be enabled for packages with provenance or that
  have existed for a minimum period (for example, 30 days).
- A publisher cannot switch from `"none"` to `"require"` or `"require-human"`
  without a version bump and a deprecation notice.
- Scoped packages and organizations may enable `"require"` immediately;
  `"require-human"` still requires maturity.
- The CI signal catalog is versioned and auditable. False positives can be
  reported and corrected.
- `spam_user` (externally `blocked`) classification is deliberately punitive:
  `spam_user` clients are not offered a human challenge, email fallback, or
  CAPTCHA. They must stop the abusive behavior or use an approved
  `automation`/`service` token after publisher/admin review.

### Browser trust check page

When the CLI opens `trust_check_url` in a context where a native OS prompt is
not available (for example, an older OS or a browser-based install flow), the
user sees a lightweight, branded page rather than a generic error. The page
must:

- Display the package identity (name, version, publisher, provenance status).
- Show the publisher's or ecosystem trust mark prominently. For example, the
  `mcp-trustcard` trust check page uses the trustcard shield logo:

  ![trustcard logo](assets/trustcard-logo.png)

- Explain why the trust check is required and how automation is handled
  (zero-config heuristic pass; no tokens needed).
- Offer a WebAuthn / passkey verification button as the primary action.
- Not offer a visual or cognitive CAPTCHA. The only allowed fallbacks are
  hardware-bound trust check, a one-time email link to a verified address, or an
  OAuth re-authorization for logged-in users.
- If an email link fallback is used, keep it to two clicks: one click to
  request the link, and one click on the "Verify this install" button in the
  email. No copying codes, no switching apps to paste, no additional forms.
- Issue a short-lived, opaque trust check token to the CLI on success.

A reference HTML/CSS mockup is included alongside this RFC:

- [`assets/trust-check-ui-mockup.html`](assets/trust-check-ui-mockup.html)
- [`assets/trust-check-ui-mockup.png`](assets/trust-check-ui-mockup.png)
- [`assets/trustcard-logo.png`](assets/trustcard-logo.png)

The mockup demonstrates a centered card layout with the trustcard logo as the
hero mark, a package metadata panel, a "Provenance verified" badge, and a
primary "Verify with passkey" button. The secondary fallback is a one-time
email link, not a CAPTCHA.

### Icons and imagery guidelines

- **Hero mark:** publisher or ecosystem trust logo (shield, lock, or verified
  badge). Avoid animated or ad-like imagery.
- **Status icons:** a small lock for provenance, a robot outline for heuristic
  automation, and a user silhouette for human sessions.
- **Action icons:** fingerprint / security-key icon for WebAuthn, email icon
  for the one-time link fallback, OAuth provider icons when available.
- **Forbidden:** image-based CAPTCHA widgets, puzzle grids, "click all traffic
  lights" interfaces, or any visual challenge an LLM can solve.
- **Color palette:** neutral grays for the shell, a single brand accent color
  for primary actions, and amber for informational notices.

## Dead CAPTCHA Rationale

Visual and cognitive CAPTCHAs are explicitly deprecated in this protocol. They
are no longer a meaningful barrier to automated or adversarial clients and are
harmful to legitimate users.

1. **LLM Computer Use can solve them.** Modern agents can already interact with
   GUIs, read distorted text, click puzzle tiles, and solve "I am not a robot"
   challenges through the same input modalities as a human.
2. **Computer vision and image models bypass image challenges.** Grids of
   traffic lights, crosswalks, and buses can be parsed reliably by off-the-shelf
   vision models.
3. **Audio and text CAPTCHAs are similarly weak.** Speech-to-text and reading
   comprehension models defeat audio and logic-puzzle variants.
4. **Accessibility is poor.** CAPTCHAs create friction for screen-reader users,
   motor-impaired users, and users on low-bandwidth or constrained devices.
5. **They add latency without adding security.** A CAPTCHA round-trip slows
   down an install and gives publishers a false sense of protection.

This protocol relies on what an automated agent physically cannot access: the
developer's local hardware and biometric secure enclave. WebAuthn / FIDO2 with
user presence, platform authenticators (Touch ID, Windows Hello), and hardware
security keys require physical interaction with a device. A remote LLM running
in a cloud sandbox cannot touch a fingerprint sensor, a TPM, or a YubiKey.

Because of these facts, the browser trust check page and CLI flow must not
offer a CAPTCHA option. The only permitted fallbacks are hardware-bound trust
check, a one-time email link to a verified address, or OAuth re-authorization
for a logged-in, reputable account.

## Rationale and Alternatives

1. **Do nothing / rely on global rate limits.** Global limits do not give
   publishers visibility into whether traffic is human or automated, and they
   cannot apply a per-package policy.
2. **Manual scoped tokens for every CI job.** This is operationally expensive,
   excludes public forks, one-off scripts, and scrapers that are not malicious.
   It also does not help publishers understand real human usage.
3. **Image-based or cognitive CAPTCHA at install time.** This is rejected
   because it is poor for accessibility, easily solved by LLM computer-use and
   computer-vision systems, and adds friction without meaningful security. This
   RFC explicitly deprecates CAPTCHA as a primary or fallback mechanism.
4. **Package `postinstall` challenge.** Lifecycle scripts can be disabled with
   `--ignore-scripts`, cannot reliably detect a terminal, and are a poor
   security boundary. They also cannot stop the tarball from being downloaded.
5. **Client-side wrapper (`npx <pkg>-install`).** This is trivially bypassed and
   does not protect the registry or the publisher's metrics.
6. **Mandatory trust check for all public packages.** This would be
   catastrophically disruptive and harm npm adoption. The feature must be
   publisher-opt-in.

The chosen design is a registry-side, per-package gate with three lanes:
heuristic automation classification for zero-config CI, hardware-bound
biometric trust check for humans, and a hard `spam_user` (`blocked`) category
for known scrapers and abuse. It gives publishers the signal they need, preserves
the friction-free CI experience, removes CAPTCHA as a viable bypass, and stops
plain scrapers from consuming a human challenge.

## Implementation

### Registry

- Build and maintain the CI signal catalog (ASN, IP ranges, UA patterns, TLS
  fingerprints).
- Build and maintain an abuse signal catalog (known scraper ASNs, TOR exit
  nodes, open proxies, exploit tooling signatures, rate-limit violators).
- Add `X-NPM-Trust-Check-Challenge` to metadata responses and validate the
  echoed value on tarball requests.
- Add `trustCheck` to the package document schema.
- Update the tarball endpoint to classify requests and emit
  `install-trust-check` events.
- Implement 403 `TRUST_CHECK_BLOCKED` for `spam_user` classification.
- Implement 428 `Precondition Required` for human trust check and the anonymous
  `heuristic-automation` / `unattended` token issuance flow.
- Integrate WebAuthn verification into the trust check service.
- Add reputation fast-pass checks to account/session endpoints.

### CLI

- Add `npm-trust-check` header support and challenge-echo logic to `npm install`.
- Detect interactive vs non-interactive environments.
- In non-interactive or high-confidence CI environments, rely on the
  registry's heuristic response.
- In interactive environments or after `HUMAN_TRUST_CHECK_REQUIRED`, trigger
  the native OS WebAuthn / biometric prompt.
- Cache `heuristic-automation`, `unattended`, and `human` tokens locally.
- Add `NPM_TRUST_CHECK=human|unattended` override for false positives.
- Keep `npm token create --kind=automation|--kind=service` for publishers who
  need higher-trust explicit tokens.

### Web

- Build the `/trust-check/install` endpoint.
- Integrate WebAuthn / passkey ceremony with existing npm account/auth.
- Provide only hardware-bound or account-reputation fallback paths.
- If offering an email link fallback, send a one-button deep link so the total
  user interaction is two clicks (request + confirm).
- Explicitly do not implement image-based CAPTCHA.

### Documentation

- Update registry API documentation, access-token docs, and the acceptable-use
  policy to describe the new behavior, signal catalog, and rate-limit classes.
- Publish the rationale for deprecating CAPTCHA for transparency.

## Prior Art

- **Docker Hub** unauthenticated pull limits and authenticated rate tiers.
- **PyPI** project file-size and bandwidth limits.
- **GitHub Packages** scoped tokens and OIDC trusted publishing.
- **npm provenance / Sigstore** (publish-time attestation): this RFC is
  complementary. Provenance says where a package was built; install trust check
  says who requested the install.
- **Cloudflare Turnstile** and **hCaptcha** invisible challenges distinguish
  humans from bots without interactive puzzles. This RFC goes further by
  removing visual challenges entirely.
- **WebAuthn / FIDO2** user-presence ceremonies provide a hardware-backed
  proof-of-humanity used by major identity providers.
- **Device-bound credentials** in native apps (iOS Secure Enclave, Windows
  Hello, Android Keystore) use local biometric authentication.

## Unresolved Questions and Bikeshedding

1. How often should the CI signal catalog be updated, and who maintains the
   canonical list of cloud provider IP ranges?
2. Should `heuristic-automation` classification require the
   `X-NPM-Trust-Check-Challenge` echo, or should ASN/UA alone be enough for a
   fast pass?
3. What is the exact reputation score formula for the fast pass? Account age,
   2FA, GitHub linkage, prior trust check history, package ownership?
4. How should false positives be handled? A `NPM_TRUST_CHECK=human` environment
   override is proposed; should there also be a registry appeal process?
5. Should `unattended` and `heuristic-automation` tokens be bound to a package
   scope, or should one token cover all installs in a session? Scope binding is
   safer; session binding is more convenient for CI with many dependencies.
6. Should old npm clients be served tarballs for `"require"` packages at all,
   or should they always get a 429 with a manual URL? Keeping them served
   avoids breaking legacy workflows but weakens the gate.
7. Should the gate apply to package metadata (`GET /:pkg`) or only to tarball
   fetches? Applying only to tarballs limits impact but may be bypassed by
   mirrors that already have the metadata.
8. What is the path for CI providers on private networks or custom runners that
   the heuristic catalog misses? Explicit `automation` tokens remain available
   as an opt-in fallback.
